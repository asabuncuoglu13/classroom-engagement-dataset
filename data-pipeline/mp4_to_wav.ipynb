      "[01:18.440 --> 01:19.440]  I'm going to stop talking about that.\n",
      "[01:19.440 --> 01:21.440]  That's not the important part, but I wanted to make that clear if you happen to be, if\n",
      "[01:21.440 --> 01:23.440]  you just want to, like, race ahead and see all the videos.\n",
      "[01:23.440 --> 01:24.440]  All right.\n",
      "[01:24.440 --> 01:25.440]  So what does it mean to program a computer?\n",
      "[01:25.440 --> 01:26.440]  So what it means to program a computer is to write a set of instructions for the computer\n",
      "[01:26.440 --> 01:27.440]  to follow.\n",
      "[01:27.440 --> 01:28.440]  And the way that I'm going to frame that for the purpose of this course is all about writing\n",
      "[01:28.440 --> 01:29.440]  instructions for the computer to follow.\n",
      "[01:29.440 --> 01:30.440]  So it's not a magic thing to do.\n",
      "[01:30.440 --> 01:31.440]  It's a magic thing to do.\n",
      "[01:31.440 --> 01:32.440]  And you're providing instructions for things that should appear in the window.\n",
      "[01:32.440 --> 01:33.440]  Draw a rectangle.\n",
      "[01:33.440 --> 01:34.440]  Draw a blue rectangle.\n",
      "[01:34.440 --> 01:35.440]  Draw a 10 rectangle.\n",
      "[01:35.440 --> 01:47.440]  Draw a rectangle in a circle, then a rectangle in a circle, and alternate the colors black\n",
      "[01:47.440 --> 01:48.440]  and white, black and white, black and white.\n",
      "[01:48.440 --> 01:52.440]  There are so many ways that we could think about how you might be English or whatever\n",
      "[01:52.440 --> 01:56.440]  your native language is, instruct the computer to follow some algorithm.\n",
      "[01:56.440 --> 02:01.440]  An algorithm being a series of steps to execute to solve a problem.\n",
      "[02:01.440 --> 02:06.440]  Writing code is code instruction to execute an algorithm, a series of steps to solve some\n",
      "[02:06.440 --> 02:07.440]  bigger problems.\n",
      "[02:07.440 --> 02:09.440]  Now, in this course, we're not going to solve a problem.\n",
      "[02:09.440 --> 02:13.440]  And hopefully you might solve some problems, but you can also just play around and experiment\n",
      "[02:13.440 --> 02:14.440]  and make beautiful pictures.\n",
      "[02:14.440 --> 02:16.440]  And that's where we're going to start.\n",
      "[02:16.440 --> 02:19.440]  But we need some way of doing this together.\n",
      "[02:19.440 --> 02:20.440]  Drawing a rectangle.\n",
      "[02:20.440 --> 02:21.440]  Drawing a circle.\n",
      "[02:21.440 --> 02:23.440]  The computer doesn't understand that.\n",
      "[02:23.440 --> 02:26.440]  You and I can understand that if we speak the same language, or even if we don't, we\n",
      "[02:26.440 --> 02:30.440]  might be able to use body language or some other way of human intuition to communicate.\n",
      "[02:30.440 --> 02:35.440]  But the computer requires specific syntax.\n",
      "[02:35.440 --> 02:41.440]  And the syntax that you need, the syntax is defined by the programming language you choose\n",
      "[02:41.440 --> 02:43.440]  to write your code in.\n",
      "[02:43.440 --> 02:46.440]  Good boy, good boy.\n",
      "[02:46.440 --> 02:51.440]  Go have fun Googling what's the best programming language to learn in 2400.\n",
      "[02:51.440 --> 02:54.440]  Whatever time in the future that you're watching this video.\n",
      "[02:54.440 --> 02:56.440]  I'm not going to worry myself with any of that stuff.\n",
      "[02:56.440 --> 02:57.440]  I'm going to pick something.\n",
      "[02:57.440 --> 03:00.440]  I'm going to pick a programming language called JavaScript.\n",
      "[03:00.440 --> 03:05.440]  The reason I'm going to pick it is because it happens to be one that I know a little bit.\n",
      "[03:05.440 --> 03:08.440]  And it also happens to be one in which there is a particular library.\n",
      "[03:08.440 --> 03:09.440]  We'll talk about what that is.\n",
      "[03:09.440 --> 03:15.440]  A library of code helper functions that will help you along with JavaScript called C5JS.\n",
      "[03:15.440 --> 03:19.440]  This is a particular library that's created by a nonprofit organization called the Processing\n",
      "[03:19.440 --> 03:23.440]  Foundation with lots of links about the Processing Foundation and all of its initiatives.\n",
      "[03:23.440 --> 03:28.440]  It's an open source project which means it's all there, available, all of how P5J works\n",
      "[03:28.440 --> 03:31.440]  is all available for you to learn and find out about.\n",
      "[03:31.440 --> 03:35.440]  And as a beginner, one of the missions of P5 is beginners who learn the code, are just\n",
      "[03:35.440 --> 03:38.440]  users of P5, but can be contributors.\n",
      "[03:38.440 --> 03:42.440]  So you can participate in helping to make this tool that you are learning to use.\n",
      "[03:42.440 --> 03:43.440]  I encourage you to get involved with that.\n",
      "[03:43.440 --> 03:45.440]  I'm happy to help facilitate that.\n",
      "[03:45.440 --> 03:49.440]  So by the way, P5JS also grew out of another project that's part of the Processing Foundation\n",
      "[03:49.440 --> 03:50.440]  which is just called Processing.\n",
      "[03:50.440 --> 03:52.440]  It uses very confusing errors.\n",
      "[03:52.440 --> 03:54.440]  I'm going to stop talking about different programming languages.\n",
      "[03:54.440 --> 03:58.440]  It's built on top of a programming language called Java, which sounds a lot like JavaScript.\n",
      "[03:58.440 --> 04:02.440]  In fact, JavaScript was named JavaScript because at the time Java was like the super cool thing\n",
      "[04:02.440 --> 04:05.440]  to use and it still is for me, I suppose.\n",
      "[04:05.440 --> 04:08.440]  But I don't know if you've ever been to one of those web pages where it's like getting\n",
      "[04:08.440 --> 04:10.440]  lots of error messages about a Java applet.\n",
      "[04:10.440 --> 04:12.440]  It's not so well suited for sharing on the web.\n",
      "[04:12.440 --> 04:16.440]  And JavaScript is the programming language of the browser.\n",
      "[04:16.440 --> 04:20.440]  So if you want to make this strange picture, which is square, circle, square, circle, square,\n",
      "[04:20.440 --> 04:26.440]  happen in the browser by writing instructions in JavaScript, you can use the P5JS library.\n",
      "[04:26.440 --> 04:30.440]  You can share it instantly with your friends, with your family, with your coworkers, with\n",
      "[04:30.440 --> 04:32.440]  your fellow students, you can get feedback.\n",
      "[04:32.440 --> 04:35.440]  And I'm going to show you how to do all of this in this video series.\n",
      "[04:35.440 --> 04:42.440]  Now, again, it's important to note this is not the only way to learn to program.\n",
      "[04:42.440 --> 05:06.440]  So if you were here in the room with me out.\n",
      "Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language\n",
      "Detected language: English\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  She is about to correct me if she didn't know what she was trying to say.\n",
      "[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  I'd ask you to just like shout out the names of other programming languages you know about.\n",
      "[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  You might say like Python or C or C sharp or cobalt or I don't know something else.\n",
      "[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  Java, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n",
      "[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  We could keep going on and on and there's no particular order.\n",
      "[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  My goal for you in this course is to learn about the concepts of programming, to be creative with programming,\n",
      "[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  to discover how to realize your own ideas through coding and vote.\n",
      "[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  And this is a nice place for us to start.\n",
      "[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  We're going to get the benefit of being able to put our stuff instantly in the web browser.\n",
      "[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  And if some day you discover some of these other tools make sense for other projects you would like to learn,\n",
      "[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  this is going to give you a foundation of knowledge for that.\n",
      "[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  In this playlist in this series and all the videos that I'm going to make them,\n",
      "[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  or walking through learning the code, you will also, somewhat by accident,\n",
      "[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  learn a little bit about something called an HTML and a CSS.\n",
      "[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  HTML and CSS or other pieces of the puzzle for making something up here online.\n",
      "[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  I'm going to focus, focus, focus on JavaScript,\n",
      "[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  and you're not going to see anything about HTML and CSS for quite a while.\n",
      "[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  But there's these underlying other mechanics for how content is formatted and styled to appear on a web page.\n",
      "[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  So while this is not a web development course, because if you know anything about web development,\n",
      "[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  you might by accident learn to do some web development by taking this course,\n",
      "[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  but by watching these videos and following along.\n",
      "[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  All right, so I'm wrapping up this video.\n",
      "[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  The next video is really where I'm going to get started. I'm going to show you,\n",
      "[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  this is what you type, and then this is what happens.\n",
      "[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  And this is why this happens when you type it.\n",
      "[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  And this is what happens if you type it this way, this breaks it, but this way fixes it.\n",
      "[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  And we're just going to rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, do that over and over again,\n",
      "[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  for all the little fundamental pieces and building blocks of learning to create your own songs.\n",
      "[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  But I want to just show you a few URLs that you can sort of poke around and read about\n",
      "[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  before you move on to the next video if you're interested.\n",
      "[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  So this is the P5.js website. This is the website that has a place where you can sort of learn\n",
      "[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  about the P5.js project. This reference page is going to be very important,\n",
      "[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  because it's the place we're going to look up. Like, I forgot what this thing does.\n",
      "[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  We're going to look at the reference page.\n",
      "[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  This learn page has some additional tutorials that you could look at.\n",
      "[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  There's lots of examples here that we could click around and play with.\n",
      "[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  I could just click on example, like Game of Life here, and we could see this is the code.\n",
      "[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  What is going on here? This looks crazy. Look at all the syntax and the situation of stuff.\n",
      "[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  By the end of this whole playlist, this will make sense.\n",
      "[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  Does that ever make sense to anybody looking at code that you didn't write? I'm not really sure.\n",
      "[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  But you will start to understand what the pieces are.\n",
      "[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  What is the process for building up a particular project like this?\n",
      "[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  And this is a well-known algorithm called the Game of Life,\n",
      "[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  a mathematical algorithm that involves how cells on a grid turn black or white\n",
      "[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  based on what the other cells are doing. It's kind of like this bacterial, like,\n",
      "[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  stipulations. Oh, there's so many things we can do.\n",
      "[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  Actually, I have a whole video tutorial building this up from scratch,\n",
      "[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  so you can go and find it. But stay with me here.\n",
      "[03:10.000 --> 03:11.000]  So this is the P5.js website.\n",
      "[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Once again, I want to mention P5.js was made.\n",
      "[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  Actually, one of the things I want to point out here is I want to go here on community.\n",
      "[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  I think P5 has a really wonderful community statement, which is really important.\n",
      "[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  So I encourage you to go to the P5.js community statement and read it.\n",
      "[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  P5.js is created by the processing foundation.\n",
      "[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  I'll show you the processing foundation in the fellowship program.\n",
      "[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Here's a whole lot of people.\n",
      "[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Lauren McCarthy is the creator of the P5.js library.\n",
      "[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  So I want to learn more about how did this project come about\n",
      "[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  by looking at the processing foundation website,\n",
      "[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  the original processing project, which is the Java-based platform.\n",
      "[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  If you're looking for inspiration, I particularly recommend this exhibition page\n",
      "[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  where you can find really lots of interesting and beautiful interactive projects made with code.\n",
      "[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  Okay, now, here's the part that I'm so excited about,\n",
      "[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  because this is like, wait, this is a project.\n",
      "[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  The P5.js web editor, this is an editor that you can use,\n",
      "[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  that you can use and write code in the browser, save your projects,\n",
      "[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  share your projects with, look, there's that Game of Life thing again.\n",
      "[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  Without anything, you don't need to download anything at all.\n",
      "[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  I'm going to show you, look, there I am, that's weird.\n",
      "[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  And I'm going to show you how to use the P5.js web editor while you're learning the code.\n",
      "[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  I do want to mention that if you are interested in all of the features of the web editor,\n",
      "[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  watch this video by Cassie Tarakitian.\n",
      "[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  This is not a beginner programming video,\n",
      "[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  but it's a video of some people who have a little bit of programming already,\n",
      "[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  to see what the all of the web editor can do.\n",
      "[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  You can watch that for some time.\n",
      "[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  Accessibility is a core feature of the P5 web editor.\n",
      "[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  You are low vision, are blind,\n",
      "[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  there are a lot of features built into the web editor to allow you to code with it.\n",
      "[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  And Matura talks about all the people who contributed to that effort\n",
      "[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  and those accessibility features in this video,\n",
      "[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  as well as if you are a teacher and you want to teach with P5,\n",
      "[04:57.000 --> 05:23.000]  if you want to use these videos or make your own or write your own curriculum.\n",
      "Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language\n",
      "Detected language: English\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  I am planning to make my own series about how to use my WebEditor and Google Classwork\n",
      "[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  together.\n",
      "[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  So if you're interested in that, stay tuned, I'll be making a video on that.\n",
      "[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  So now, this is the P5 WebEditor.\n",
      "[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  There it is.\n",
      "[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  So, look, this is some code.\n",
      "[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  Did this look so bad?\n",
      "[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  Function set up.\n",
      "[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  What is that?\n",
      "[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Create Canvas.\n",
      "[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  What is that?\n",
      "[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  Background 220.\n",
      "[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  What is that?\n",
      "[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Function draw.\n",
      "[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  What is that?\n",
      "[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  This is all the stuff that I'm going to talk about precisely in the next video.\n",
      "[00:29.000 --> 00:33.200]  So, in the next video, I'm going to show you what kind of things can you type here, what\n",
      "[00:33.200 --> 00:37.000]  ends up happening over here when you type them, and why, and I'm just going to go from\n",
      "[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  video after video after video, adding this piece, then this piece, then this piece.\n",
      "[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  And by the end, you can make your own interactive, animated game, artwork, data visualization.\n",
      "[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  Who knows?\n",
      "[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  You're going to be much more creative and come up with something much better than I can possibly\n",
      "[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  imagine right now.\n",
      "[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  Okay.\n",
      "[00:51.000 --> 00:52.000]  So, if you're excited about that, great.\n",
      "[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Keep on watching.\n",
      "[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  There's also lots of other things in the world, like programming.\n",
      "[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  So, you can go do that stuff too, and especially like being with people and putting in neighbors\n",
      "[01:00.000 --> 01:01.000]  and stuff like that.\n",
      "[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  I'm going to go now.\n",
      "[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  I have to stretch my hands straight because I've got back problems and that's going to\n",
      "[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  help.\n",
      "[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  Ah, yeah, I got that in there.\n",
      "[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  All right.\n",
      "[01:09.000 --> 01:10.000]  See you all later.\n",
      "[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  See you next video.\n",
      "[01:11.000 --> 01:37.000]  Thank you.\n",
      "[01:37.000 --> 01:53.000]  All right, hi.\n",
      "[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  Why is the background pink?\n",
      "[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  That is the question that I would like to answer in this video.\n",
      "[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  Color.\n",
      "[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  Color is the next thing.\n",
      "[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  You probably may have, you watched the last video, you hopefully made some beautiful\n",
      "[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  interesting art.\n",
      "[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's not going to be beautiful, but make your own art.\n",
      "[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  You're proud of it.\n",
      "[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  I'm proud of you for making it.\n",
      "[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  Now you want to add color.\n",
      "[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  You want to add color anyway, but you didn't.\n",
      "[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  I'm going to show you that.\n",
      "[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  Now before I do that, I do want to mention some other kind of logistical things that\n",
      "[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  I've kind of forgotten to mention.\n",
      "[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  So one thing is whenever I create a sketch with a T5 web editor, I'm going to put a link\n",
      "[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  to that sketch in the video's description.\n",
      "[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  So you can go down to the video's description and click on it.\n",
      "[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  And so if you go to the link to the sketch, you're actually going to go to a page just\n",
      "[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  like this.\n",
      "[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  It's going to have the same code.\n",
      "[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  If you play, it's going to have the same object.\n",
      "[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  Now you might have different, you might not have the dark theme with high contrast turned\n",
      "[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  on.\n",
      "[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Your layout might look a little different, but ultimately the code is going to be the same.\n",
      "[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  And you won't have a state option because you're looking at a project that's made that I made\n",
      "[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  in my account that I've shared with you.\n",
      "[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  So let me bear with you for a second.\n",
      "[02:40.000 --> 02:41.000]  I'm going to be right back.\n",
      "[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  So I'm back.\n",
      "[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Now this is another sketch that I've made for another course.\n",
      "[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  I've got to kind of get to all this stuff and how all this kind of stuff works.\n",
      "[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  But even now, look at all this complicated code.\n",
      "[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000]  It kind of makes some sense to you, right?\n",
      "[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  Oh, line, you know about that.\n",
      "[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  Ellipse, you know about that.\n",
      "[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  Ooh, this is X and Y.\n",
      "[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  There's all this stuff we're going to get to.\n",
      "[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  But this is a sketch called Oscillation by Nature of Code, which is a different account.\n",
      "[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  So if I could edit this code, right, I could say like line, you know, 100.\n",
      "[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  And then, oh, it's doing something slightly different, I'm not sure what exactly.\n",
      "[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  But I can't do, I can't, there's no state option.\n",
      "[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Where's the state option?\n",
      "[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  You're going to want to go to File, Duplicate.\n",
      "[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  And suddenly you're going to see that it says Oscillation Copied by the Coding Train.\n",
      "[03:10.000 --> 03:11.000]  I could rename this.\n",
      "[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  I could say Oscillation Demo for YouTube or something.\n",
      "[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  I could rename my sketch.\n",
      "[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  But this is how when you go to a sketch that I've made, you will come to a page that says,\n",
      "[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  you know, Color Example by Coding Train.\n",
      "[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  And you will then do File, Duplicate and start writing.\n",
      "[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  But it doesn't matter.\n",
      "[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's not going to be so simple.\n",
      "[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  You don't necessarily need to duplicate my code to keep doing it.\n",
      "[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  But that's an important piece as I go through future videos.\n",
      "[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  I want to mention that on the outside of this video.\n",
      "[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  Okay, I'm not going to worry about that.\n",
      "[03:30.000 --> 03:31.000]  I'm going to go like, now we're back here.\n",
      "[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Color.\n",
      "[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  How does color work?\n",
      "[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  Oh, I'm going to hear it.\n",
      "[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  Yeah, I should have thought of this before I start recording this video.\n",
      "[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  But here's what I'm going to say with three still.\n",
      "[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  RGV.\n",
      "[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  Remember this.\n",
      "[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  RGV.\n",
      "[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  RGV.\n",
      "[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  R stands for red.\n",
      "[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  G stands for green.\n",
      "[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  B stands for blue.\n",
      "[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  The way that you create a digital color is by mixing some amount of red, some amount of green,\n",
      "[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  and some amount of blue.\n",
      "[03:53.000 --> 03:54.000]  So that's where I want to start.\n",
      "[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  But that's the concept.\n",
      "[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  How do I apply that concept to function names and arguments of those functions?\n",
      "[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  We have done that already.\n",
      "[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  Here, there is a function that is talking about color.\n",
      "[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  Background is a function that draws a solid color over the entire background.\n",
      "[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  And there is somehow 220 sprinkles of red, zero sprinkles of green.\n",
      "[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  RGV.\n",
      "[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  RGV.\n",
      "[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  And when you sprinkle that amount of red and that amount of blue, you get this thing.\n",
      "[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  But let's just go with this. What if we take out all the blue? You can see that's pretty red.\n",
      "[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  What if I take out all of the red? Now it's black.\n",
      "[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  What if I just put some really big numbers in here, like just guess, like a thousand?\n",
      "[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  Look at that.\n",
      "[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  Now we've got white.\n",
      "[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  So all the colors all mix together.\n",
      "[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  Make white.\n",
      "[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  That's weird, right?\n",
      "[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Because if you work with green, you work to mix all the colors.\n",
      "[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  All like a whole lot of pink together.\n",
      "[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  You get this like brown, muddy color.\n",
      "[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  Get darker and darker.\n",
      "[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  This is the way that the color mixing is working here.\n",
      "[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  It's like mixing in light.\n",
      "[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  So it's more that the analogy here is I have a red flashlight, a green flashlight, and a blue flashlight.\n",
      "[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  And if I shine all those flashlights together in the same spot, they mix together.\n",
      "[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  Add a good color.\n",
      "[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  The more we add up all those colors, the brighter and brighter it gets.\n",
      "[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  But actually, this is the same as the fact that I'm pointing a thousand in here.\n",
      "[04:56.000 --> 05:18.000]  The idea here is we're sprinkling a certain amount of red and a certain amount of green and a certain amount of blue.\n",
      "Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language\n",
      "Detected language: English\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  By the way, there are other ways to set color.\n",
      "[00:01.860 --> 00:02.700]  I'll get to that.\n",
      "[00:02.700 --> 00:03.540]  This is not the only way.\n",
      "[00:03.540 --> 00:04.380]  Some of you are watching, like,\n",
      "[00:04.380 --> 00:05.300]  what about I heard something about agent B, color,\n",
      "[00:05.300 --> 00:06.620]  and there's all sorts of other ways to do it,\n",
      "[00:06.620 --> 00:08.300]  but this is the fundamental basic way.\n",
      "[00:08.300 --> 00:11.740]  The amount that I want that I can sprinkle has a range.\n",
      "[00:11.740 --> 00:14.660]  None killed red, none more red, is zero.\n",
      "[00:14.660 --> 00:17.260]  The maximum amount of red is 251.\n",
      "[00:17.260 --> 00:18.500]  By the way, how many numbers are there?\n",
      "[00:18.500 --> 00:20.420]  Zero, 255, and H is zero?\n",
      "[00:20.420 --> 00:21.260]  Zero, what's the other one?\n",
      "[00:21.260 --> 00:22.100]  256.\n",
      "[00:22.100 --> 00:23.300]  Again, we're back to this weird counting from zero.\n",
      "[00:23.300 --> 00:25.780]  So there's 256 possibilities, zero through 255.\n",
      "[00:25.780 --> 00:27.660]  So now we can go back and we can kind of see,\n",
      "[00:27.660 --> 00:29.100]  let's come back to this.\n",
      "[00:29.100 --> 00:32.500]  All right, zero, let's go back to zero, zero, zero.\n",
      "[00:32.500 --> 00:34.060]  Let's do 200, let's do 255.\n",
      "[00:34.060 --> 00:36.620]  We can see there's blue, let's do 100,000.\n",
      "[00:36.620 --> 00:37.460]  It's the same blue.\n",
      "[00:37.460 --> 00:38.980]  So P5 is kind of smart enough to know\n",
      "[00:38.980 --> 00:40.060]  when you call the background function.\n",
      "[00:40.060 --> 00:41.180]  If you by accident put a number in there\n",
      "[00:41.180 --> 00:43.020]  that's bigger than 255, just consider it 255.\n",
      "[00:43.020 --> 00:45.100]  Okay, so write those ridges for yourself\n",
      "[00:45.100 --> 00:46.300]  and there's a reason why you might want to do that.\n",
      "[00:46.300 --> 00:47.260]  Again, when we come back to that,\n",
      "[00:47.260 --> 00:48.660]  we just look up the subject color mode,\n",
      "[00:48.660 --> 00:50.540]  how to do that, but let's just stay with the default.\n",
      "[00:50.540 --> 00:52.460]  A red, a green, and a blue.\n",
      "[00:52.460 --> 00:55.420]  So I'm not really very talented visual design-wise,\n",
      "[00:55.420 --> 00:56.460]  so I'm not going to talk to you about\n",
      "[00:56.460 --> 00:58.500]  how to pick beautiful colors to work well together.\n",
      "[00:58.500 --> 01:01.060]  Okay, hopefully you can have that talent to sell my best\n",
      "[01:01.060 --> 01:02.140]  or you might find some other resources,\n",
      "[01:02.140 --> 01:02.980]  but this is how it works.\n",
      "[01:02.980 --> 01:03.820]  R, D, V.\n",
      "[01:03.820 --> 01:05.180]  One thing you might notice is,\n",
      "[01:05.180 --> 01:07.620]  did you notice how when they were all zero,\n",
      "[01:07.620 --> 01:09.300]  it was black, and when they were all 255 it was white,\n",
      "[01:09.300 --> 01:11.100]  what happens if I make them all like 100?\n",
      "[01:12.260 --> 01:13.180]  It's like this gray color.\n",
      "[01:13.180 --> 01:14.900]  When R equals G equals V,\n",
      "[01:14.900 --> 01:16.980]  when the red, green, and blue values are all equal,\n",
      "[01:16.980 --> 01:18.620]  this is something known as gray-scale color.\n",
      "[01:18.620 --> 01:20.620]  Gray-scale color is a color,\n",
      "[01:20.620 --> 01:22.700]  no saturation is a term, it's desaturated,\n",
      "[01:22.700 --> 01:24.420]  it's a color, but it's gray.\n",
      "[01:24.420 --> 01:27.220]  Zero through 255, zero being black, 255 being white.\n",
      "[01:27.220 --> 01:29.100]  For shorthand, all of the color functions,\n",
      "[01:29.100 --> 01:29.940]  and there's more of them,\n",
      "[01:29.940 --> 01:31.900]  allow you to, if you want to do a gray-scale function,\n",
      "[01:31.900 --> 01:34.260]  you can skip having all three, and you could just use one.\n",
      "[01:34.260 --> 01:36.260]  So if you put one argument in the background function,\n",
      "[01:36.260 --> 01:37.340]  you're assuming a gray-scale color.\n",
      "[01:37.340 --> 01:38.620]  Let's make a note of this,\n",
      "[01:38.620 --> 01:41.980]  because there are a lot of different ways.\n",
      "[01:41.980 --> 01:46.340]  So let's assume that there's some type of color function.\n",
      "[01:46.340 --> 01:48.060]  Background is the one we know right now.\n",
      "[01:48.060 --> 01:51.340]  If it has one argument, this is gray-scale.\n",

      "[03:15.420 --> 03:16.900]  Now I'm gonna say, what's the outline?\n",
      "[03:16.900 --> 03:19.660]  It's black, so by the way, the default fill in P5 is white,\n",

      "[03:59.780 --> 04:02.060]  You see how the ellipse is on top of the rectangle?\n",
      "[04:02.060 --> 04:03.860]  It's because it's drawn after it.\n",
      "[04:03.860 --> 04:07.020]  But you need to set the color of what you're about to draw.\n",

      "[04:09.140 --> 04:11.140]  Well, that's set to blue, that's set to green.\n",
      "[04:11.140 --> 04:12.740]  The ellipse is still picking up that fill and stroke.\n",
      "[04:12.740 --> 04:14.020]  It's going to be like, it's like you're saying,\n",
      "[04:14.020 --> 04:15.980]  hey, computer thing that's drawing the stuff,\n",
      "[04:15.980 --> 04:16.820]  pick up this pen.\n",
      "[04:16.820 --> 04:19.340]  And I told him to pick up this green pen for the interior,\n",
      "[04:19.340 --> 04:20.180]  I meant to make it red.\n",
      "[04:20.180 --> 04:22.180]  But I told him after it already drew the ellipse.\n",
      "[04:22.180 --> 04:23.020]  Let's make this red.\n",
      "[04:23.020 --> 04:24.220]  That's what we've done straight.\n",
      "[04:24.220 --> 04:25.940]  But if I go and I take this and I put it before it,\n",
      "[04:25.940 --> 04:27.980]  it's not really, look at that.\n",
      "[04:27.980 --> 04:29.060]  So I kind of want to group things.\n",
      "[04:29.060 --> 04:30.820]  I can add some, the idea here is I can make a stroke\n",
      "[04:30.820 --> 04:33.060]  that's like 255, that's just some gray scale color.\n",
      "[04:33.060 --> 04:35.780]  So you can see like, the interior here is blue.\n",
      "[04:35.780 --> 04:37.620]  Outline is green, interior ready, outline.\n",
      "[04:37.620 --> 04:39.780]  You should show me what you're seeing here.\n",
      "[04:39.780 --> 04:40.620]  You probably don't like this.\n",
      "[04:40.620 --> 04:41.460]  I have to tell you.\n",
      "[04:43.460 --> 04:44.700]  Why, why, why, why?\n",
      "[04:44.700 --> 04:45.940]  When we looked over here in the reference,\n",
      "[04:45.940 --> 04:47.060]  is there a no fill and no stroke?\n",
      "[04:47.060 --> 04:47.900]  And by the way, I encourage you to go\n",
      "[04:47.900 --> 04:49.700]  and read them because you'll find the things\n",
      "[04:49.700 --> 04:51.340]  I explained to you, I explained that, probably.\n",
      "[04:51.340 --> 04:52.180]  Come on, too.\n",
      "[04:52.180 --> 04:53.020]  There's also an example.\n",
      "[04:53.020 --> 04:53.860]  Why is there no fill and no stroke?\n",
      "[04:53.860 --> 04:54.700]  Well, you might think to yourself,\n",
      "[04:54.700 --> 04:56.540]  oh, what if I don't want this circle to have an outline?\n",
      "[04:56.540 --> 04:57.780]  No outline of that circle, please.\n",
      "[04:57.780 --> 04:59.100]  Oh, I'll just put zero in there, right?\n",
      "[04:59.100 --> 05:19.100]  Zero, let's be like, no outline of that circle.\n",
      "Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language\n",
      "Detected language: English\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  But remember, zero is not the outline.\n",
      "[00:01.480 --> 00:03.020]  Zero is outline zero.\n",
      "[00:03.020 --> 00:07.480]  And this is why instead of stroke, if I say no stroke,\n",
      "[00:07.480 --> 00:08.960]  then suddenly there's no outline.\n",
      "[00:08.960 --> 00:10.640]  So no stroke means no outline.\n",
      "[00:10.640 --> 00:12.160]  Say the answer is no.\n",
      "[00:12.160 --> 00:13.320]  No, no.\n",
      "[00:13.320 --> 00:14.160]  It's no.\n",
      "[00:14.160 --> 00:16.160]  So I'm just seeing the background color come through.\n",
      "[00:16.160 --> 00:17.760]  But I've only drawn the outline of that shape.\n",
      "[00:17.760 --> 00:20.200]  Now I'm going to go back and put the fill in.\n",
      "[00:20.200 --> 00:22.440]  And I realize there's a few other things I want to talk about.\n",
      "[00:22.440 --> 00:24.520]  So remember I said there were lots of ways.\n",
      "[00:24.520 --> 00:25.020]  What?\n",
      "[00:25.020 --> 00:27.000]  There's another way I could have.\n",
      "[00:27.000 --> 00:28.480]  D, 3, 4.\n",
      "[00:28.480 --> 00:33.120]  The fourth argument is, and so RGD is not the whole picture.\n",
      "[00:33.120 --> 00:36.880]  There is also bar, GD, A, and A stands for the whole picture.\n",
      "[00:36.880 --> 00:39.360]  I want to work with you.\n",
      "[00:39.360 --> 00:40.960]  This is the color of this one.\n",
      "[00:40.960 --> 00:42.520]  Yeah, is it the only one?\n",
      "[00:42.520 --> 00:46.080]  So by the way, there's a thing right here, 255.\n",
      "[00:46.080 --> 00:47.640]  255 is the default.\n",
      "[00:47.640 --> 00:49.280]  That color is all over there.\n",
      "[00:49.280 --> 00:50.760]  Is that a robot like capacity?\n",
      "[00:50.760 --> 00:52.560]  So this idea of thinking the color of the picture\n",
      "[00:52.560 --> 00:53.800]  has to just blend with what's behind it.\n",
      "[00:53.800 --> 00:55.640]  Now, of course, this is all about the crazy illusion of that.\n",
      "[00:55.640 --> 00:56.440]  There's no blending.\n",
      "[00:56.440 --> 00:58.280]  It's just a single picture with the color.\n",
      "[00:58.280 --> 01:00.280]  But 255, no, if it wants to appear transparent,\n",
      "[01:00.280 --> 01:01.280]  it knows what color it wants.\n",
      "[01:01.280 --> 01:02.600]  You can figure out how to make that illusion happen.\n",
      "[01:02.600 --> 01:04.880]  So for example, if you come over here for this ellipse,\n",
      "[01:04.880 --> 01:05.960]  there's a ellipse that's red.\n",
      "[01:05.960 --> 01:08.080]  What if I were to add, if I were to say comma 255 here,\n",
      "[01:08.080 --> 01:08.840]  nothing has changed.\n",
      "[01:08.840 --> 01:09.920]  I'm adding that alpha value.\n",
      "[01:09.920 --> 01:11.440]  If I put 0 there, it's gone.\n",
      "[01:11.440 --> 01:13.680]  If it's fully transparent, I can't see it at all.\n",
      "[01:13.680 --> 01:15.040]  If I make this 100, look at that.\n",
      "[01:15.040 --> 01:17.600]  You can see how it looks like when it's blending with the background.\n",
      "[01:17.600 --> 01:19.640]  So maybe I want to just get a little bit more, 175,\n",
      "[01:19.640 --> 01:20.360]  and start to see that.\n",
      "[01:20.360 --> 01:22.280]  So this is something you can play with transparent.\n",
      "[01:22.280 --> 01:23.840]  Just to finish this whole thing off,\n",
      "[01:23.840 --> 01:26.080]  I can have one argument for anything background-filling stroke\n",
      "[01:26.080 --> 01:28.800]  is a gray scale comma 255. 3 arguments is an RGB color\n",
      "[01:28.800 --> 01:30.200]  with 100% opacity.\n",
      "[01:30.200 --> 01:31.040]  It's fully OK.\n",
      "[01:31.040 --> 01:32.200]  It is not at all transparent.\n",
      "[01:32.200 --> 01:34.400]  If I add a fourth argument, I get an RGB color\n",
      "[01:34.400 --> 01:35.400]  that's so non-transparency.\n",
      "[01:35.400 --> 01:38.120]  And by the way, if I just use two numbers,\n",
      "[01:38.120 --> 01:41.960]  then I've got a gray scale with some gray scale value.\n",
      "[01:41.960 --> 01:43.400]  So those are all of the options.\n",
      "[01:43.400 --> 01:44.600]  Now, what is your science?\n",
      "[01:44.600 --> 01:46.280]  If you're watching this, you're going to make something.\n",
      "[01:46.280 --> 01:48.440]  Take your drawing, give it color, fill it with color.\n",
      "[01:48.440 --> 01:51.680]  Set the background, set the fill and stroke into the shape.\n",
      "[01:51.680 --> 01:53.800]  Give me one more little treat here.\n",
      "[01:53.800 --> 01:56.200]  If I add a function called stroke weight,\n",
      "[01:56.200 --> 01:57.600]  this is a function that's not setting the color.\n",
      "[01:57.600 --> 02:00.720]  But I'm not trying to show you that the outline of this,\n",
      "[02:00.720 --> 02:02.320]  maybe the outline of this is like red.\n",
      "[02:02.320 --> 02:04.480]  And I'm kind of like, oh, I can't even see it.\n",
      "[02:04.480 --> 02:05.120]  Let me get blue.\n",
      "[02:05.120 --> 02:07.800]  Oh, do you know why I have so much more to show you?\n",
      "[02:07.800 --> 02:08.680]  That the outline is blue?\n",
      "[02:08.680 --> 02:10.520]  I have to zoom all the way in to show it to you?\n",
      "[02:10.520 --> 02:12.160]  What if I add this thing called stroke weight?\n",
      "[02:12.160 --> 02:13.400]  And you put the number one in there.\n",
      "[02:13.400 --> 02:15.320]  What that number one means is the outline of the shape\n",
      "[02:15.320 --> 02:16.400]  is 1 pixel wide.\n",
      "[02:16.400 --> 02:18.240]  It's a thin 1 pixel wide outline.\n",
      "[02:18.240 --> 02:19.040]  You mean 2?\n",
      "[02:19.040 --> 02:19.920]  I could make that 8.\n",
      "[02:19.920 --> 02:20.420]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:20.420 --> 02:20.920]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:20.920 --> 02:21.840]  It's so much thicker.\n",
      "[02:21.840 --> 02:23.240]  So I can show this to you.\n",
      "[02:23.240 --> 02:26.000]  I could be sort of insane to make this like 24 or 100 and die.\n",
      "[02:26.000 --> 02:28.120]  It's only like the stroke is wider than the actual shape itself.\n",
      "[02:28.120 --> 02:30.960]  But the point is just to be able to adjust it with that outline.\n",
      "[02:30.960 --> 02:32.440]  That's what you do with your stroke weight.\n",
      "[02:32.440 --> 02:33.440]  I'm joking.\n",
      "[02:33.440 --> 02:35.480]  Actually, I want you to show me something like, oh, comment in.\n",
      "[02:35.480 --> 02:35.960]  And errors.\n",
      "[02:35.960 --> 02:36.640]  This is really important.\n",
      "[02:36.640 --> 02:37.400]  I'm skipping over that.\n",
      "[02:37.400 --> 02:37.960]  I'm going to do that.\n",
      "[02:37.960 --> 02:39.560]  I'm going to make a video about that separately\n",

      "[00:02.660 --> 00:04.160]  Well, what's defining where the circle is?\n",
      "[00:04.160 --> 00:05.460]  The number 200 and the number one thing.\n",
      "[00:05.460 --> 00:06.460]  Those are literal bounds.\n",
      "[00:06.460 --> 00:09.460]  That number 200 could never be anything but the number 200 itself.\n",
      "[00:09.460 --> 00:12.460]  We'd like to just sort of describe in there instead something about where the mouse is.\n",

      "[00:16.460 --> 00:17.460]  Obviously, I can't do that.\n",
      "[00:17.460 --> 00:18.460]  What I can do, what a variable is, is in a named XG.\n",
      "[00:18.460 --> 00:19.460]  It's a key word that stores something.\n",
      "[00:19.460 --> 00:20.460]  In this case, I want to store a number.\n",

      "[00:22.460 --> 00:24.460]  In this case, I want something that stores references of the value.\n",
      "[00:24.460 --> 00:34.460]  In the P5 reference, we can see this described quite clearly, and the system variable mouseX always contains the current horizontal position of the mouse relative to 00.\n",
      "[00:34.460 --> 00:37.460]  Meaning, the moment I write mouseX here, and the sketch re-runs, look at that.\n",
      "[00:37.460 --> 00:39.460]  This is where my mouse is. That's where the ellipse is. I'm going to move it over.\n",

      "[00:40.460 --> 00:41.460]  So what's really happening here?\n",
      "[00:41.460 --> 00:42.460]  Did I lock the ellipse to a mouse in some magic way?\n",
      "[00:42.460 --> 00:44.460]  No, I'm just looking at the draw loop that's happening over and over again.\n",
      "[00:44.460 --> 00:46.460]  Every time I'm always getting the dynamic, current value of mouseX.\n",
      "[00:46.460 --> 00:47.460]  The circle's X position doesn't have me.\n",
      "[00:47.460 --> 00:49.460]  Where mouseX is, for example, there's no reason why I can change.\n",
      "[00:49.460 --> 00:50.460]  I put mouseX here for the Y value.\n",
      "[00:50.460 --> 00:54.460]  Now as I move my mouse, I have the right mouse position, which is very comfortable. It moves up and down, but think about the kind of interaction it needs to be able to.\n",
      "[00:54.460 --> 00:56.460]  For example, if there's no reason why I can put mouseY here, it can still.\n",
      "[00:56.460 --> 01:00.460]  So as I move the mouse up and down, the circle gets larger, up, right, or down.\n",
      "[01:00.460 --> 01:01.460]  So this is really starting from Q.\n",
      "[01:01.460 --> 01:03.460]  What can you do just with the system variable mouseX and mouseY?\n",
      "[01:03.460 --> 01:05.460]  One thing, you could do exactly the same.\n",
      "[01:05.460 --> 01:07.460]  And so I'm going to just add a few more things that doesn't need to do with that.\n",
      "[01:07.460 --> 01:09.460]  I'm going to go back to something more traditional.\n",
      "[01:09.460 --> 01:10.460]  Just make this bill 255.\n",
      "[01:10.460 --> 01:12.460]  I'm going to put the ellipse at mouseX and mouseY.\n",
      "[01:12.460 --> 01:13.460]  And I'm going to check this.\n",
      "[01:13.460 --> 01:14.460]  And incidentally, I don't remember whether I covered this before.\n",
      "[01:14.460 --> 01:20.460]  If it's a circle, I don't need to have both arguments. I can just click in one argument as a diameter.\n",
      "[01:20.460 --> 01:21.460]  Now I'm going to do something slightly more precise.\n",
      "[01:21.460 --> 01:23.460]  I'm going to take this background, call it the background.\n",
      "[01:23.460 --> 01:24.460]  I'm going to remove it and put it in the setup.\n",
      "[01:24.460 --> 01:25.460]  Run the sketch again.\n",
      "[01:25.460 --> 01:26.460]  I'm not going to move my mouse over there.\n",
      "[01:26.460 --> 01:27.460]  I want you to imagine, what do you think is going to happen?\n",
      "[01:27.460 --> 01:30.460]  I'll get the video open and see if you can predict what's going to happen.\n",
      "[01:30.460 --> 01:32.460]  In fact, here we go.\n",
      "[01:32.460 --> 01:34.460]  In the back corner of the screen.\n",
      "[01:34.460 --> 01:36.460]  Why am I here?\n",
      "[01:36.460 --> 01:42.460]  Well, the reason why I was in the middle of the program was because I was drawing the background over and over again to draw.\n",
      "[01:42.460 --> 01:44.460]  The background circle, background circle, background circle.\n",
      "[01:44.460 --> 01:45.460]  So you've got to move to the motion.\n",
      "[01:45.460 --> 01:46.460]  The background will go once in the setup.\n",
      "[01:46.460 --> 01:47.460]  Suddenly, I'm not racing anymore.\n",
      "[01:47.460 --> 01:49.460]  See where the circle is, where it is now, where it is now.\n",
      "[01:49.460 --> 01:51.460]  So this is this idea of having flexibly been able to decide what order of things is happening.\n",
      "[01:51.460 --> 01:53.460]  I can now create a couple of other variables.\n",
      "[01:53.460 --> 01:54.460]  I'm going to do a couple of things.\n",
      "[01:54.460 --> 01:55.460]  I'm going to do a couple of things.\n",
      "[01:55.460 --> 01:56.460]  So now you can see the longer it's there.\n",
      "[01:56.460 --> 01:57.460]  That alpha goes up.\n",
      "[01:57.460 --> 01:58.460]  It allows a little versatility.\n",
      "[01:58.460 --> 01:59.460]  You can decide.\n",
      "[01:59.460 --> 02:00.460]  You can play with color.\n",
      "[02:00.460 --> 02:01.460]  But one more thing I want to do is work.\n",
      "[02:01.460 --> 02:02.460]  Noting.\n",

      "[02:03.460 --> 02:04.460]  I talked about these two blocks of code.\n",
      "[02:04.460 --> 02:15.460]  I'm going to go ahead and create a loop.\n",
      "[02:15.460 --> 02:19.460]  There are many other events that we can define.\n",
      "[02:19.460 --> 02:22.460]  I've written another function here.\n",
      "[02:22.460 --> 02:23.460]  Mouse press.\n",
      "[02:23.460 --> 02:25.460]  This is an event that sticks in the way that you can define an else.\n",
      "[02:25.460 --> 02:26.460]  It can happen.\n",
      "[02:26.460 --> 02:27.460]  It can happen.\n",
      "[02:27.460 --> 02:28.460]  It can only happen if you press the mouse.\n",
      "[02:28.460 --> 02:29.460]  If you click the mouse, it can happen.\n",
      "[02:29.460 --> 02:30.460]  It can happen.\n",
      "[02:30.460 --> 02:31.300]  Let's get started.\n",
      "[02:31.300 --> 02:32.140]  Step up once, ready to go.\n",
      "[02:32.140 --> 02:32.960]  Draw is just like,\n",
      "[02:32.960 --> 02:33.800]  I'm gonna have this much like that,\n",
      "[02:33.800 --> 02:35.140]  and the mouse press function is very patient.\n",
      "[02:35.140 --> 02:36.340]  What happens if I take a background\n",
      "[02:36.340 --> 02:38.220]  and put that in mouse press?\n",
      "[02:38.220 --> 02:39.580]  Now the mouse press note is the same syntax,\n",
      "[02:39.580 --> 02:40.580]  function, the name of the function,\n",
      "[02:40.580 --> 02:41.920]  parentheses, curly, grabby, close, curly, grabby.\n",
      "[02:41.920 --> 02:42.760]  I'm gonna take background,\n",
      "[02:42.760 --> 02:44.660]  and I'm gonna copy it into mouse press.\n",
      "[02:44.660 --> 02:46.180]  Now as I move the mouse, I can try to write my name,\n",
      "[02:46.180 --> 02:47.020]  and I know I messed up,\n",
      "[02:47.020 --> 02:47.840]  and I'm gonna click the mouse,\n",
      "[02:47.840 --> 02:48.680]  and voila.\n",
      "[02:48.680 --> 02:49.520]  I draw the background over,\n",
      "[02:49.520 --> 02:50.520]  and I erase what was there for you to see.\n",
      "[02:50.520 --> 02:51.540]  I know I think I might be one other question\n",
      "[02:51.540 --> 02:52.540]  that's in your head that I'm anticipating.\n",
      "[02:52.540 --> 02:53.380]  Let's go back to just for a moment\n",
      "[02:53.380 --> 03:11.380]  and see what the background was in fact in drawing.\n",
      "[03:11.380 --> 03:34.060]  It's well-named because we're using it the way we're using it\n",
